**Title: UTME for Hate Speech Detection and Monitoring**

In the ever-evolving landscape of online communication, the rise of hate speech has become a pressing concern. To address this challenge, UTME emerges as a powerful solution. This tutorial explores the motivation behind using UTME and the importance of automated mining and monitoring of hate speech texts.

### Motivation for Using UTME

Traditional methods of text classification often face limitations in adaptability across diverse taxonomies due to the requirement for extensive labeled datasets. UTME provides a versatile and unsupervised approach, allowing users to classify documents within a custom hierarchical taxonomy without the need for labeled data. The unsupervised taxonomy expansion feature further empowers users to dynamically generate subcategories based on document content, offering a granular understanding of the data.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial: Putting UTME into Action

Now, let's walk through a step-by-step on how to leverage UTME for hate speech detection:

1. **Initialize UTME:**
   - Set up your UTME environment. UTME leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating its effectiveness across proprietary, open-source, and low-computational-cost models. Its adaptability makes it a practical choice for users and organizations seeking advanced text mining capabilities without requiring extensive computational resources.


```python
from utme.UTME import UTME
from utme.BinaryClassifier import BinaryClassifier
from utme.TaxonomyClassifier import TaxonomyClassifier
from utme.SubcategoryGenerator import SubcategoryGenerator

# Initialize UTME with LLM (Language Model) credentials
llm_key = "your_llm_key"
llm_endpoint = "your_llm_url_endpoint"
llm_options = {'model': "openchat_3.5", 'max_tokens': 1024}
utme_base = UTME(llm_endpoint, llm_key, llm_options)
```


2. **Define Context and Taxonomy:**
   - Clearly define the context and taxonomy relevant to hate speech detection. This step establishes the framework for classification.


```python
# Define context and taxonomy for hate speech analysis
context = '''Hate speech refers to any form of communication that promotes prejudice, discrimination, or animosity against individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other defining characteristics. Racial: Discriminatory language targeting a person's race or ethnicity. Religious: Prejudice or hostility based on someone's religious beliefs. Gender-based: Discrimination based on gender, often reinforcing traditional stereotypes. Sexual Orientation: Derogatory remarks about someone's sexual orientation. Disability-based: Offensive language related to a person's physical or mental abilities. Age-based: Discrimination based on a person's age, often manifesting as ageism. Nationality-based: Prejudice against individuals from a specific country or nationality. Class-based: Discrimination based on socioeconomic status or class. Appearance-based: Offensive remarks about a person's physical appearance. Language-based: Discriminatory language targeting a specific language or dialect. Political Affiliation: Prejudice based on a person's political beliefs or affiliation. Ideology-based: Discrimination related to a person's ideological views. Immigration Status: Discrimination based on a person's immigration or citizenship status. Body-shaming: Derogatory comments about a person's body size or shape. Educational Background: Discrimination based on a person's educational achievements or lack thereof. Refugees: Offensive language targeting individuals who are refugees or seeking asylum. Geographical Location: Discrimination based on a person's place of origin or residence. Weight-based: Offensive comments about a person's weight. Sexual Harassment Language: Offensive comments of a sexual nature that contribute to a hostile environment. Microaggressions: Subtle, often unintentional, expressions of prejudice or discrimination.'''

taxonomy = '''0 NONE: The @DOCUMENT does not contain hate speech
1 Racial Hate Speech
2 Religious Hate Speech
3 Gender-based Hate Speech
4 Sexual Orientation Hate Speech
5 Disability-based Hate Speech
6 Class-based Hate Speech
7 Political Hate Speech
8 Age-based Hate Speech
9 Appearance-based Hate Speech
10 Nationality-based Hate Speech'''
```

In the UTME framework, the definition of context and taxonomy is flexible, requiring a degree of experimentation and creativity. It can be tailored to the specifics of the Large Language Model (LLM) used by UTME. While context is crucial throughout the process, it plays a pivotal role in BinaryClassification, thereby filtering texts of interest before taxonomy mapping.

For the taxonomy, used in TaxonomyClassifier, there is a specific format to follow. Each taxonomy item is a line starting with an increasing numerical identifier. It is imperative that the initial taxonomy item is "0 NONE", serving as the second filter for texts of interest.

3. **Binary Classification for Text Filtering:**
   - Use the Binary Classifier to filter texts of interest, focusing on documents that may contain hate speech.

```python
# Start BinaryClassifier to filter documents of interest
bc = BinaryClassifier(utme_base, context)
y_pred = bc.classify(df.text.to_list())
df['y_pred'] = y_pred
df_filtered = df[df.y_pred == 'YES']
```

The BinaryClassifier module in UTME employs a few-shot prompt learning approach, utilizing only the provided context to make predictions. It operates by prompting the model with the contextual information and expects a binary response: YES for hate speech and NO for non hate speech. 

4. **Taxonomy Mapping – First Level:**
   - Employ the Taxonomy Classifier to map documents within the predefined hierarchical taxonomy at the first level.

```python
# Start TaxonomyClassifier to map documents to predefined categories (First Level)
tc = TaxonomyClassifier(bc, taxonomy)
taxonomy_pred = tc.classify(df_filtered.text.to_list())
df_filtered['level1'] = taxonomy_pred
df_filtered_level1 = df_filtered[~df_filtered.level1.str.contains('NONE')]
```

The TaxonomyClassifier utilizes a user-defined taxonomy tailored for hate speech detection. The predefined taxonomy consists of distinct levels, such as Racial Hate Speech, Religious Hate Speech, Gender-based Hate Speech, and more. By employing this module, users can effectively categorize and identify instances of hate speech within their text data, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the specific nuances and themes associated with hateful content.

It's worth noting that for the TaxonomyClassifier, only the structure of the hate speech taxonomy is needed, without relying on labeled data for training. 

5. **Unsupervised Taxonomy Expansion – Second Level:**
   - Utilize the Subcategory Generator to dynamically expand the taxonomy, generating subcategories for more detailed analysis.

```python
# Perform Unsupervised Taxonomy Expansion (Second Level)
L = []
for category in df_filtered_level1.level1.unique():
    sg = SubcategoryGenerator(tc)
    df_category = df_filtered_level1[df_filtered_level1.level1 == category]

    # Generate subcategories for the selected category
    subcategories = sg.generate_subcategories(category, df_category.sample(expansion_sample_size, replace=True).text.to_list())

    # Classify documents using the expanded subcategories
    tc2 = TaxonomyClassifier(bc, subcategories)
    taxonomy_pred2 = tc2.classify(df_category.text.to_list())

    df_category['level2'] = taxonomy_pred2
    L.append(df_category)
df_filtered_level2 = pd.concat(L)
```

The SubcategoryGenerator in UTME is essential for unsupervised taxonomy expansion, creating subcategories within predefined categories. For example, if the TaxonomyClassifier identifies a document under "Gender-based Hate Speech," the SubcategoryGenerator can generate subcategories like "Sexual Harassment Language" or "Body-shaming" based on the document content. This unsupervised approach enables the system to discover subtopics without labeled data, enhancing exploratory analysis and taxonomy development.

6. **Graph-Based Analysis for Exploration:**
   - Leverage UTME's graph-based analysis to visually explore document relationships, aiding in the identification and monitoring of hate speech patterns.


```python
# Start SubcategoryGenerator for graph generation
sg = SubcategoryGenerator(tc)
sg.graph_generation(df_filtered_level2)
sg.graph_export_cosmograph(df_filtered_level2)
``` 

The UTME also facilitates graph analysis through the generated nodes.csv and edges.csv files, allowing for exploratory analysis of the results. In this graph, each hate speech text serves as a vertex, and similar texts are connected. UTME generates connections by exploring both document similarity and the predefined hate speech taxonomy. For analyzing large graphs, the Cosmograph app is recommended, providing robust features for graph visualization and exploration.
